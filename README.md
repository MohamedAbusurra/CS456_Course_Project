# Course Timetabling Local Search

Local-search based solver for a course timetabling problem. Two algorithms are provided: a hill climbing and simulated annealing with temperature based acceptance. Both use the same fitness to score schedule quality (lower is better) and operate on a 6×4 day/slot timetable.

## Problem Model

- State: 2D list `[day][slot]` where each cell holds a `LinkedList<CourseNode>`.
- Moves: pick a course and move it either to another slot on the same day or the same slot on another day.
- Fitness: summed penalties for conflicts in a timetable (hard + soft):
  - Instructor double-booked in a slot: +1200
  - Courses from the same semester in a slot: +1000
  - Courses one/two/three years apart in a slot: +150 / +50 / +25
  - Same course appearing multiple times in one day: +75

## Algorithms

- Hill Climbing
  - Evaluates neighbors generated by single-course moves; moves to a neighbor with the lowest fitness.
  - Uses a seeded `Random` to break ties when multiple best neighbors exist.
  - Stops when the fitness hits 0 or no equal/better neighbor exists (stuck).
  - Prints step and fitness each iteration.
- Simulated Annealing
  - Selected a random neighbor each step; accepts if better and may accept worse states with probability.
  - Temperature starts at a configured value and cools by a rate each iteration until 0 or max iterations reached.
  - Stops early if fitness hits 0.
  - Prints step, fitness, and temperature each iteration.

## Input

- `testRuns.txt`: each line is one test case. Courses are seperated by commas. Example:
  ```
  courseId,semester,instructorId
  ```
  `&` separates courses. Example:
  ```
  CS101,1,5,&,PH105,1,6,&,CS120,2,7
  ```

## Output

- 'results.txt': prints the following for each test case entererd using all searches
  - initial number of hard and soft constraints.
  - final number of hard and soft constraints.
  - initial and final fitness function.
  - total run time.
  - total number of iterations.
